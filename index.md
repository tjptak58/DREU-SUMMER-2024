## About Me

My name is TJ Ptak and I'm a junior at Purdue University studying Computer Science. I'm earning a concentration in computational science and love to learn how computing can be applied to people and physical systems. My main motivation for pursuing computer science is to go into the music tech industry. I'm an avid musician and have always longed to find a bridge between my work and my passion. The DREU program has allowed me to make that dream a reality. Last summer I worked with Dr. Kyla McMullen at the University of Florida. There I worked in the SoundPad 3-D Audio Lab learning about spatial audio. This summer, I'm working with Dr. Ian Hattwick of MIT on collaborative musical instruments.

## About My Mentor

My mentor for the Summer of 2024 is Dr. Ian Hattwick of MIT. When I studied at MIT, I took MUS 21.080 with Dr. Hattwick. Dr. Hattwick is an artist, researcher, and technology developer whose work focuses on the creation and use of digital systems for professional artistic performances. With a background in music composition and performance, he is particularly interested in the use of multimodal hardware systems to explore and facilitate social and embodied interaction.

## About My Project

This summer, my project is "Tuning-in on the Web: Developing a Framework for ensemble interaction in the Browser". Making music using browser-based web apps is isolating. While several different approaches exist on the web, there is much to research on sharing information and knowledge in real-time that deals with structural and gestural information. Tuning-in on the Web aims to create a framework and set of examples of collaborative musical instruments developed for the browser. It will build on the Web Audio Sandbox, a framework developed in the summer of 2023 for the MIT course Intro to Music Tech (21M.080). We'll leverage that framework to develop a new set of software focused on strategies for musical interaction and collaboration over the Internet. Core to this will be a set of browser-based instruments that allow performers to see and interact with the gestures and choices of their fellow musicians.
