  With our roles assigned, this week we started developing our first instruments. I'm doing this REU remotely for the summer but to get the most out of our brainstorming, I decided to travel to MIT for the week to work in person. We started the week researching synths and sequencers we could model our first project on. We decided to go with the Dato Duo, a simple synth/sequencer marketed for babies. It has an 8-step sequencer and a two-oscillator subtractive synthesizer. All things considered, it's a simple synthesizer so it made for a good proof-of-concept project. Working in person, I was able to ask my mentor questions and go to the hardware synths in the lab for inspiration. 
  To create instruments on the web, you need to use JavaScript's Web Audio API which came out in 2011. It allows a developer to create sound on the browser through JS code. The API works but is very confusing for laymen. Because of this, Yotan Mann, a researcher at NYU created a library called ToneJS which packages the Web Audio API into a more intuitive framework. This is the framework we are using in our research. I spent the week learning Tone and created the synth voice for our Dato Duo clone.
