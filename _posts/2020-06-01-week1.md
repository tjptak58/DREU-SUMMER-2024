The goal of my research project is to develop collaborative musical instruments which are hosted on the web. Doing this takes knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, and the Web Audio API. I've built websites in the past, but a lot of what we're doing in this project is new to me. I spent the first week reviewing HTML and CSS while learning the basics of JavaScript. I also had meetings with my team members to talk about our individual goals and the goals of the project. After a couple of meetings, we could tell what each of us wanted to work on within the project. Being a musician, I was most interested in the sound design and UX of the instruments we were making so I'm taking the lead on that. I'm very excited about the project
