This week, I worked with Ian to finish the Ascii handler and the DatoDuo class. Once this was finished, he gave me a new task. He said before I work on the 4 voice step sequencer, He wanted me to create something for myself. He told me, "come up with a synth idea and make it happen". I spent a couple of days researching different synths to gauge the possibilities. I decided that I was going to make a polyphonic synth modeled after Logic Pro X's ES P. On Wednesday, I met with Ian to get advice and set off to create the synth.

The rest of the week...
