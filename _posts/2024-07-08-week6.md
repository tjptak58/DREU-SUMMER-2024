title: Week 6

This week, I worked with Ian to finish the Ascii handler and the DatoDuo class. Once this was finished, he gave me a new task. He said before I work on the 4 voice step sequencer, He wanted me to create something for myself. He told me, "come up with a synth idea and make it happen". I spent a couple of days researching different synths to gauge the possibilities. I decided that I was going to make a polyphonic synth modeled after Logic Pro X's ES P. On Wednesday, I met with Ian to get advice and set off to create the synth.

The rest of the week I took his advice and started mapping out how I was going to create the synth. I drew a diagram of what the user interface would look like then I worked from that to design the signal flow. The ES P is a 6-voice, subtractive synthesizer so it was very similar to the DatoDuo. The biggest difference was the fact that there were 6 voices instead of one. Usually when creating a subtractive synth, you start with a sine, saw, or square wave and filter from there. With the ES P, you start with a mix of a sine, saw, noise, and 3 square waves. Do do this I needed to create an MultiVCO object that could manage playing multiple waves at the same time.
