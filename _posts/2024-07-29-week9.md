This week, I worked on creating two deliverables that showcased the power of the tech we created this summer. My first project was a cover of the song Cars by Gary Neuman. I used the ESPSynth I created to model the sounds from the track and used ToneJS Part to write the notes out. A demo to this project can be found [here](https://youtu.be/310CiVy04jc?si=EpYNt1o_yMA54rU6). My second project was the audience choir I mentioned in the last post.  In a live show, the host would open their webpage and hook the computer up to the PA. Then the performers would give a QR code to the audience which would link to the crowd webpage. This would let them interact with the instrument onstage. A demo can be found [here](https://youtu.be/N2UCk9_Rkic?si=J_6adKt9G9ERlcEO)
