title: Week 3

At the start of the week, my part of the Dato Duo was done but we weren't finished. We still needed the sequencer and the framework for collaboration. While I did more studying, the rest of my team finished the sequencer and used CollabHub - a service for creating collaborative software - to implement collaboration into the instrument. By Tuesday, we had a working instrument! This showed us what it took to create the instruments we were trying to make and gave us proof that our idea could work. 

We spent the rest of the week brainstorming our next project and working on new ideas. Currently, we're working on a 4 voice step sequencer that uses the computer keyboard as an interface.
