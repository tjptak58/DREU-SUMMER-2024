title: Week 8
---

Since I had the ES P finished, my next goal was to make the synth polyphonic (playing multiple notes at the same time). Ian had explored this idea a year ago but only had it working for one synth. Our goal for the week was to generalize it so any synth could be passed into the Polyphonic() class making it polyphonic. It turned out not to be very hard since Ian had solved the problem before. We took the solution he had and built a class around it so any synth could use it. 

During our meeting on Monday, we also talked about our goals for the rest of the summer. We've all been working independently for most of the summer but Ian wanted us to come together to brainstorm new ideas. Since the start of the summer, we've introduced new synths, a sequencer, sharable links, and collaborative features to the 21M.080 website (Intro to Music Tech at MIT). Our next goal is to create projects demonstrating the power of the features we've created. Somehow this was harder than the coding! We decided we were going to use all our features together to create really interesting new instruments and musical projects. 

My main interest is creating instruments that an audience can interact with. For example, with our website, a performer can create an instrument and use a QR code to send it to audience members. Then they can interact with their interface and control aspects of the audio being played on stage.
