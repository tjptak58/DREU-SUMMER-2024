title: Week 4

While the DataDuo project was working, my mentor Ian had some issues with the way the instrument was sounding. The effects weren't having the effect he expected so I spent the week rewriting the signal flow for the effects chain. In the DataDuo there are 3 effects: distortion, bitcrusher, and delay. Fixing the distortion and bitcrusher were easy though delay took more thought. The delay I created has a gain stage running into the delay, into a low pass filter with a cutoff frequency modulated by a LFO. This is combined with the dry signal to create the delay effect. One delay knob is then used to adjust multiple parameters of the delay (feedback, dry/wet, LFO frequency, etc.)

Along with the effects, I spent time adjusting the parameter ranges and curves of the knobs and faders. In any instrument, it's the designer's job to set the min and max levels of all the parameters available to the user. These levels need to be set thoughtfully so the user can have a good experience playing with the instrument. It's also important to adjust the curves so adjusting the knob/fader always has a noticeable impact. To implement this, I created helper functions.
