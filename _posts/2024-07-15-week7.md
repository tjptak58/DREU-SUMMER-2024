title: Week 7

I started the week working on the MultiVCO object and putting together my ES P synth. It was hard to implement all the features that apple had implemented but It taught me a lot. I also added created documentation for how to use the Ascii Handler we created. As the week went on, I finished the ES P and made a class out of it.
