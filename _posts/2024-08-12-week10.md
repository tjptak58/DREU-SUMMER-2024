title: Week 10

My last week was a wrap-up week for the most part. I spent time writing my final paper for DREU and worked with my mentor to plan steps for the future. After the summer is over, I plan to continue working on this project, developing more instruments I can use with my band. I have a band at Purdue that plays house parties and my goal is to implement these tools into our live performance. Hopefully one day in the future, we'll gain enough of a following where companies and other bands will take notice of what we're doing. My team and I plan on changing the way audiences can interact with performers, allowing them to directly influence instruments on stage from their phones.
