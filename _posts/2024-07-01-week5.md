My mentor was out sick for most of this week, so I spent my time learning about synthesis methods. Our next goal is to create a 4 voice step sequencer using the keyboard as an interface. The four voices are a kick, snare, hihat, and percussion. To implement this, I need to understand how drum synthesis works and how I can create a sound of my own to add to the project. I used various online resources to learn about this.

I also started working on a couple more tasks Ian assigned to me. To use the keyboard as an interface, the code needs support for handing Ascii notes. On my own, I created a handler for processing Ascii notes and will check it with Ian next week. To create multiple voices in an organized way, it's also important to create a class for each voice. As an introduction to classes in Javascript, Ian tasked me with making the DatoDuo a class. I spent the rest of the week working on those tasks though didn't finish.
